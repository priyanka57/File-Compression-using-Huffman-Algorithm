# File-Compression-using-Huffman-Algorithm

Team work of Priyanka Goyal, Purnima Goel and Ruchi Juneja. 

The Domain “PRPZip” lets you reduce the overall number of bits and bytes in a file so it can be transmitted faster over slower Internet connections, or take up less space on a disk. Domain PRPZip is a System Based Software. The user need not depend on third party software’s like winzip, winrar, Stuff etc.
       The main algorithms are:	
•	Huffman algorithm

The Domain “File Compression” lets you reduce the overall number of bits and bytes in a file so it can be transmitted faster over slower Internet connections, or take up less space on a disk. Domain File compression is a System Based Software. The software will be done using Core Java. It can use in the System as a utility. The type of compression we will use here is called lossless compression. The user need not depend on third party software’s like winzip, winrar, Stuff etc. the software can be used to compress files and they can be decompressed when the need arises.   For implementing this Software we want to use algorithms
       The main algorithms are:	
•	Huffman algorithm
The Domain File Compression mainly include 7 modules
•	Compress A File 
•	De-Compress the file 
•	Facility to set icon
•	Facility to set your own extension
